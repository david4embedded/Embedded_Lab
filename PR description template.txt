### Summary of Changes


### Detailed Description
 - change the ethernet pin assignment to be like in the below. This is in order to correctly reflect the H/W pins.
   . PG11  <------> ETH_TX_EN
   . PG13  <------> ETH_TXD0

 - assign a fixed IP address. i.e., 192.168.1.3 with no gateway option, for the board disabling DHCP.
 - add the test codes for the TCP/IP.
 - add the Nucleo-144 BSP files to make use of the leds on the nucleo board.
 - change the timer to the timer6 since it's a basic timer that's available; timer1 is an advanced timer.
 - add the tick information in the logging macro.
 - add RingBuffer class as a utility together with the unit tests for it.
